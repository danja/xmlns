<h1>Product Vocabulary</h1>

<h2><a name="Overview" id="Overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>An RDF vocabulary for describing manufactured artifacts and their commercial
aspects.</p>

<p>The vocabulary aims to cover the core terms needed for three conceptual
areas: description of products themselves, commercial aspects (branding etc),
part-whole relationships. </p>

<p>The design of the vocabulary will initially be driven by a specific use case
- describing the equipment found in a home studio (starting with instruments
&amp; hardware - software applications may complicate matters). Domain-specific
terms will be expressed using a custom auxiliary vocabulary. Terms from
well-known vocabularies (e.g. DC, FOAF) will be used where obviously
applicable, but no effort will be made to discover definitions for more obscure
terms (alignment with such vocabularies may be attempted after several
iterations of testing the design against real data).</p>

<p>A key requirement is to distinguish between individual physical instances of
products (my Epiphone D100 guitar has Martin FX .011 strings), specific product
types (Epiphone D100 guitars presumably ship with Epiphone strings) and generic
product types (the Epiphone D100 is an acoustic guitar). It is anticipated that
using RDFS instance/class relations directly will limit what can be said across
these layers. </p>

<p>A model that does capture these kinds of distinction in a flexible fashion
is FRBR, Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (in particular see
<a href="http://vocab.org/frbr/core">Expression of Core FRBR Concepts in
RDF</a>). However initial investigation suggests it's a little <em>too</em>
rich, and isn't appropriate for direct use. </p>

<p>For a first pass a model loosely derived from that of FRBR will be used,
along with a mix of regular RDFS/OWL and SKOS constructs.</p>

<h3>Target Application Areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Product Catalogues</li>
  <li>Knowledgebases for equipment-heavy domains </li>
  <li>Product servicing management, repairs etc.</li>
</ul>

Vocabularies</a></h3>

<h4>FRBR</h4>

<p>Several of the terms are related to concepts found in FRBR.</p>

<p>Mapping between generic products and FRBR breaks down somewhat around
Expression/Work (there may be a relationship between these terms and product
patents and IP, but for present purposes that seems out of scope).</p>

<p>Perhaps Kind/Pattern/Product should be related by skos:broader..?</p>

<h2><a name="Classes" id="Classes">Classes</a></h2>

<h4><a name="Item" id="Item">Item</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "physical object, instance of a particular product" .</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> my old strat</p>

<h4><a name="Kind" id="Kind">Kind</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "specific model or version of product, identifiable by
brand/model number etc." .</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Black &amp; White Squier Strat</p>

<h4><a name="Pattern" id="Pattern">Pattern</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "type of product, design" ;</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Stratocaster Guitar</p>

<h4><a name="Product" id="Product">Product</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "generic concept of the product" .</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Guitar</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="Properties" id="Properties">Properties</a></h2>

<h4><a name="componentO" id="componentO">componentOf</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "discrete part of" </p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Pickup <strong>componentOf</strong> Guitar</p>

<p><em>leaving domain &amp; range open for now, but if possible should later
put in a check to make sure that for a particular statement the domain &amp;
range are consistent - an Item can be a componentOf another Item but not of a
Product (mutex the classes?)</em></p>

<h4><a name="similar" id="similar">similar</a></h4>

<p>dc:description "is functionally similar to, may be substituted in most
circumstances without significant system degradation"</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Mexican built strat <strong>similar</strong> US built
strat</p>

<p>This either needs a bunch of subproperties or other way of qualifying it:</p>

<p>X similar design Y</p>

<p>X similar build Y</p>

<p>X similar performance Y</p>

<p>X similar price Y</p>

<p>X similar popularity Y</p>

<p>...</p>

<h4><a name="exemplar" id="exemplar">exemplar</a></h4>

<p>domain: Kind</p>

<p>range: Item</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Black &amp; White Squier Strat <strong>exemplar</strong>
my old strat </p>

<p><em>reusing the word from FRBR but not the term directly as undesirable
inferences likely. Would be better with a different word...(with reversed
domain &amp; range?)</em></p>

<h4><a name="embodiment" id="embodiment">embodiment</a></h4>

<p>domain: Pattern</p>

<p>range: Kind</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Stratocaster Guitar <strong>embodiment</strong> Black
&amp; White Squier Strat </p>

<p><em>reusing the word from FRBR but not the term directly as undesirable
inferences likely. Would be better with a different word...(with reversed
domain &amp; range for convenience) - or skos:broader..?</em></p>

<h4><a name="realizatio" id="realizatio">realization</a></h4>

<p>domain: Product</p>

<p>range: Pattern</p>

<p><em>Example:</em> Guitar <strong>realization</strong> Stratocaster Guitar</p>

<p><em>reusing the word from FRBR but not the term directly as undesirable
inferences likely. Would be better with a different word...(with reversed
domain &amp; range for convenience) - or skos:broader..?</em></p>
