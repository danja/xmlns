when we say “book” to
describe a physical object that has paper
pages and a binding and can sometimes be
used to prop open a door or hold up a table
leg, FRBR calls this an “item.”

When we say “book” we also may mean a
“publication” as when we go to a bookstore
to purchase a book. We may know its
ISBN but the particular copy does not
matter as long as it’s in good condition
and not missing pages. FRBR calls this
a “manifestation.”

When we say “book” as in ‘who translated
that book,’ we may have a particular text in
mind and a specific language. FRBR calls
this an “expression.”

When we say “book” as in ‘who wrote
that book,’ we could mean a higher level
of abstraction, the conceptual content that
underlies all of the linguistic versions, the story
being told in the book, the ideas in a person’s
head for the book. FRBR calls this a “work.”
