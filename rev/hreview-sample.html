  <span class="fn org">Crepes on Cole</span> is one of the best little 
  creperies in <span class="adr"><span class="locality">San Francisco</span></span>.
  Excellent food and service. Plenty of tables in a variety of sizes 
  for parties large and small.  Window seating makes for excellent 
  people watching to/from the N-Judah which stops right outside.  
  I've had many fun social gatherings here, as well as gotten 
  plenty of work done thanks to neighborhood WiFi.
